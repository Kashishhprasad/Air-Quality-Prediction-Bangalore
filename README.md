# Air-Quality-Prediction-Bangalore
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Bengaluru using historical pollution data and modern machine learning techniques.

A Random Forest Regressor is trained and fine-tuned using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), resulting in enhanced accuracy and automated hyperparameter tuning for AQI forecasting.

1. Objectives

Historical AQI and pollutant data specific to Bengaluru are collected and preprocessed.

Time-based features are engineered to boost predictive performance.

A Random Forest Regressor is employed to forecast AQI levels.

The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is applied for automatic tuning of model parameters.

Model performance is assessed through visualizations and feature importance metrics.

2. Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Grey Wolf Optimizer

3. Results

Prediction accuracy showed noticeable improvement over untuned models.

Hyperparameter tuning was automated with GWO, minimizing manual intervention.

Key contributing pollutants and trends were highlighted via visual insights.

4. Visualizations

AQI trend over time

Contribution of pollutants to AQI
